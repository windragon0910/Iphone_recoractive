Why are these files not compiled into OriginFixer?

On macOS Catalina, hardened runtime is enabled for iTunes 12.6.5. Without disabling SIP and Library Validation, inserting ad-hoc signed libraries like this one will fail. This was written as an experiment, and is only left in the codebase for future reference.

The real SIP-compatible fix is to replace Assets.car (or iTunes.rsrc) with modified assets, which Retroactive deploys instead. The main Retroactive installer also clears album art cache.

If you really want to compile this in and use this for iTunes 12.6.5, disable SIP and Library Validation on your Mac.
